This component uses a [`MediaCollection`](#mediacollection) in an [`Overlay`](#overlay) to offer the possibility to select a medias. 
The `onConfirm` callback is called with the media objects as soon as the confirm button is clicked.

This component mainly serves as base for the [`SingleMediaSelectionOverlay`](#singlemediaselectionoverlay) and
[`MultiMediaSelectionOverlay`](#multimediaselectionoverlay) components.
